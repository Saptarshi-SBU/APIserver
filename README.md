## Introduction

 A web based image hosting service for private setups built using Flask as the backend.
 The service can host both medium and high resolution pictures. There are backend services
 for downsampling and resizing images so that images are served with minimal use of network
 bandwidth. Custom image visualizations like grid views, slideshows are exposed via REST API
 endpoints.

 New extensions allow it to connect to cloud storage for fetching personal images from
 the cloud. This is useful when users tend to exceed alloted free space in the cloud.

 Now you can deploy, browse and mantain all your personal images with least concern about
 security, in a home environment.
